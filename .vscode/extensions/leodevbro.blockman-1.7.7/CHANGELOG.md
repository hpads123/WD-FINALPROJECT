## [1.7.7] - 2024-04-20

-   Fix "Rightmost Edge Of Viewport" of right side base rendering

## [1.7.6] - 2024-02-01

-   Add ability to make black list of file formats act as a white list.
        Just type '^' (caret symbol) at the left of the list, and it will become a white list.
        Like this: '^ typescript, typescriptreact'

-   Now Blockman will try to fill spaces caused by codeLens annotations.
        Well, VS Code has a limitation about rendering the block as an entire block div,
        So, Blockman renders div boxes for each line, and it creates an illusion of one big div block.
        But as the codeLens annotations create spaces between lines, it acts as a visual breaker of the nice illusion of big block.
        So, now, Blockman is trying to find the locations of the codeLens annotations, and then to fill those spaces to unbreak the illusion of a nice big div block.
